## About & Behind the Scenes

Hello! This is the second internship project I made in the past with a team of aspiring game developers (also in 2022).

Ash: Protector of Ignicity is a third-person action-adventure game. The game has a simple story of "being a hero to save your people." To achieve the goal, at every level, the main character has to explore the area and light up totems. There will be mobs and bosses you may have to eliminate along the way.

### My Contributions

- Programming in C#

- Rigging and animation (mobs and boss)

- 3D models (temple, stones, totems, mountains, pillars, etc.)
- Trailer design
